# MoreStars - Complete Documentation

> Turn every customer into a 5-star Google review. SMS and QR code review request software for local businesses.

## Company Overview

MoreStars is a SaaS platform that helps local businesses collect more Google reviews through automated SMS messages and QR codes. The platform is designed for simplicity - businesses connect their Google Business Profile, import customer data, and start sending review requests immediately.

## Problem We Solve

Local businesses struggle to get Google reviews because:
- Customers forget to leave reviews after leaving the business

1. Automated timing: SMS sent at optimal moments after transactions
